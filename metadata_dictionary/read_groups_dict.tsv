Field	Attribute	Description	Permissible Values	Note
type	Required	type of the table	read_group	
submitter_sequencing_experiment_id	Required	Unique identifier of the sequencing experiment, assigned by the data provider.	String values that meet the regular expression ^[a-zA-Z0-9]{1}[a-zA-Z0-9\\-_\\.:']{0,98}[a-zA-Z0-9]{1}$	
submitter_read_group_id	Required	The identifier of a read group. Must be unique within each sample. After submission, the submitter_read_group_id in the metadata will be used for all future @RG ID in the header.	String values that meet the regular expression ^[a-zA-Z0-9\\-_:\\.']+$.	
read_group_id_in_bam	Required	Optional field indicating the @RD ID in the BAM header and "RG:Z" in BAM body. If submitted, this will be used to map the @RG ID in the BAM header to the submitter_read_group_id in the payload. This cannot be submitted for FASTQ files.	String value must meet the regular expression ^[a-zA-Z0-9\\-_:\\.']+$ or null.	
platform_unit	Required	Unique identifier including the {FLOWCELL_BARCODE}.{LANE}.{SAMPLE_BARCODE}. The {FLOWCELL_BARCODE} refers to the unique identifier for a particular flow cell. The {LANE} indicates the lane of the flow cell and the {SAMPLE_BARCODE} is a sample/library-specific identifier. For non-multiplex sequencing, platform unit and read group have a one-to-one relationship.	Any string value.	
is_paired_end	Required	Indicate if paired-end sequencing was performed.	true, false	
file_r1	Required	Name of the sequencing file containing reads from the first end of a sequencing run.	Any string value. Must match a fileName identified in the files section.	
file_r2	Required	Name of the sequencing file containing reads from the second end of a paired-end sequencing run. Required if and only if paired-end sequencing was done.	Any string value or null. Must match a fileName identified in the files section.	
read_length_r1	Required	Length of sequencing reads in file_r1; this corresponds to the number of sequencing cycles of the first end.	Integer with a minimum value of 20 or null.	
read_length_r2	Required	Length of sequencing reads in file_r2; this corresponds to the number of sequencing cycles of the second end.	Integer with a minimum value of 20 or null.	
insert_size	Required	For paired-end sequencing, the average size of sequences between two sequencing ends. Required only for paired-end sequencing.	Integer with a minimum value of 0 or null.	
sample_barcode	Required	According to the SAM specification, this is the expected barcode bases as read by the sequencing machine in the absence of errors.	Any string value or null. 	
library_name	Required	Name of a sequencing library made from a molecular sample or a sample pool (multiplex sequencing). Must also be specified within Bam header LB.	Any string value.
